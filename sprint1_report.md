## 4. Personas

### Persona 1: Sameer, The Donor
- **Bio:** Sameer is a 20-year-old software engineering student who works part-time at a local cafe. He hates seeing leftover pastries go to waste at the end of the day.
- **Goal:** To easily list surplus food from his workplace or home so it can be claimed by students or locals in need.
- **Frustrations:** The guilt of throwing away edible food; lack of an easy way to broadcast "free food" to his campus network without spamming group chats.

### Persona 2: Mahesh, The Receiver
- **Bio:** Mahesh is a 22-year-old international student on a tight budget. He is passionate about sustainability and saving money on groceries.
- **Goal:** To find free, safe, and edible food nearby to supplement his weekly meals and reduce his environmental footprint.
- **Frustrations:** High cost of living in the city; difficulty navigating multiple apps to find affordable food; uncertainty about the quality of free items.

### Persona 3: Prativa, The Local Business Owner
- **Bio:** Prativa runs a small artisan bakery. She ends every day with 5-10 loaves of bread that are perfectly good but cannot be sold as "fresh" tomorrow.
- **Goal:** To donate bulk items quickly at closing time (5 PM) without managing complex logistics or waiting for individual pickups.
- **Frustrations:** Paying for commercial waste disposal for food that is edible; lack of tax incentives or easy documentation for donations.

### Persona 4: Dhiraj, The Community Volunteer
- **Bio:** Dhiraj organizes a local food bank distribution. He has a van and can collect larger donations.
- **Goal:** To see a map of all available large donations in the district so he can plan a pickup route efficiently.
- **Frustrations:** Arriving at a donor's location only to find the food has already been thrown away or claimed by someone else.

---

## 5. Ethical Issues Identified
- **Food Safety:** Disclaimers, ratings, and banning high-risk items.
- **Privacy:** Only approximate locations until claim confirmation.
- **Inclusivity:** Simple UI and support for older devices.

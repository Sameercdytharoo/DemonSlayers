4. Personas
### Persona 1: Sameer, The Donor * *Bio:* Sameer is a 20-year-old software engineering
student who works part-time at a local cafe. He hates seeing leftover pastries go to waste at
the end of the day. * *Goal:* To easily list surplus food from his workplace or home so it can
be claimed by students or locals in need. * *Frustrations:* The guilt of throwing away edible
food; lack of an easy way to broadcast "free food" to his campus network without spamming
group chats.
### Persona 2: Mahesh, The Receiver * *Bio:* Mahesh is a 22-year-old international student
on a tight budget. He is passionate about sustainability and saving money on groceries. *
*Goal:* To find free, safe, and edible food nearby to supplement his weekly meals and reduce
his environmental footprint. * *Frustrations:* High cost of living in the city; difficulty
navigating multiple apps to find affordable food; uncertainty about the quality of free items.
### Persona 3: Prativa, The Local Business Owner * *Bio:* Prativa runs a small artisan
bakery. She ends every day with 5-10 loaves of bread that are perfectly good but cannot be
sold as "fresh" tomorrow. * *Goal:* To donate bulk items quickly at closing time (5 PM)
without managing complex logistics or waiting for individual pickups. * *Frustrations:*
Paying for commercial waste disposal for food that is edible; lack of tax incentives or easy
documentation for donations.
### Persona 4: Dhiraj, The Community Volunteer * *Bio:* Dhiraj organizes a local food bank
distribution. He has a van and can collect larger donations. * *Goal:* To see a map of all
available large donations in the district so he can plan a pickup route efficiently. *
*Frustrations:* Arriving at a donor's location only to find the food has already been thrown
away or claimed by someone else
5. Ethical Issues Identified
• Food Safety: Disclaimers, ratings, and banning high-risk items.
• Privacy: Only approximate locations until claim confirmation.
• Inclusivity: Simple UI and support for older devices.
